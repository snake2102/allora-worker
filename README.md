```
cd ~
rm -r ~/allora-worker/
docker stop custom-inference custom-worker custom-worker-0 custom-worker-1
docker container prune -f
docker rmi custom-inference
```

## Run the custom model
1. Create an account and obtain an Upshot ApiKey [here](https://developer.upshot.xyz)

2. Clone the git repository
```
git clone https://github.com/snake2102/allora-worker.git
cd allora-worker
```

3. Run the bash script
```
bash run.sh
```

* **Mnemonic Phrase:** Import you menmonic phrase
* **Upshot ApiKey:** Import your upshot apikey
